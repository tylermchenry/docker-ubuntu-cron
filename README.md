# Docker [tylermchenry/ubuntu-cron-curl](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/tylermchenry/ubuntu-cron-curl)

Forked from [raphiz/ubuntu-cron-curl](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/raphiz/ubuntu-cron)

Ubuntu latest with cron and curl, powerd by supervisor.

You can easily replace the default `/etc/crontab` with one that suits your needs.
The image will log the syslog into stdout which makes it easy for you to
inspect the logs with `docker logs <container>`.

If you want that other files also appear in the stdout, you can set the environment
variable `FILES_TO_LOG` with a semicolon separated list of files to log (eg.
`FILES_TO_LOG=/var/log/app_info.log;/var/log/app_error.log`)
